# Get Started with Bastyon

</div>

Hello and welcome to Bastyon! We're excited to have you here and hope this project will excite you as much as it excites us!

Bastyon is on a mission to democratize how people communicate. Today, most communication is centralized. It's not an overstatement to say that anyone can get unplugged from any platform for any reason, forcing them to lose their ability to communicate with loved ones, create content, or access their own data. Bastyon is changing this.

>**Vision:**
Bastyon aims to create a resilient, decentralized ecosystem that empowers individuals with unrestricted access to communication, information, and personal data management. Our vision is to build a platform that stands strong against censorship and ensures user sovereignty in the digital realm.

This repo is meant to be an entry point into the project. It has descriptions and overview of other repos and how they are all connected.

If you know what you want to help with, you could jump straight to the [How Do I...?]() section.

> **Note:** But before you jump in, please make sure you check out [Contribution Guide](contribution.md). 

## 📝 Bastyon Architectural Overview 📝

[Coming Soon - Detailed architectural documentation and diagrams will be added here]

## 🏗️ Bastyon Platform Structure 🏗️

The Bastyon Platform consists of these main blocks:

- [Roadmap](#roadmap)
- [Documentation](#documentation)
- [Bastyon User Interfaces](#bastyon-user-interfaces)
- [Bastyon Protocols, Network, and Node Software](#bastyon-protocols-network-and-node-software)
- [Bastyon Integrations](#bastyon-integrations)

Below are the repositories for each respective platform component:

### 🗂️ Bastyon Project Overview 🗂️

`This.repo`

An entry point that helps newcomers navigate the Bastyon project.

### 🛣️ Roadmap 🛣️

This repo is used for submission, tracking, and discussion of new proposals. The conversations in this repo remain active until proposals either get approved (with a willing contributor) or rejected. In both cases, the natural end state for a proposal is to be archived with a decision note.
